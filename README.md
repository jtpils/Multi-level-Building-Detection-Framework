Detect building objects in multi-level remote sensing images

Paper: Multi-level Building Detection Framework in Remote Sensing Images Based on Convolutional Neural Networks

The code may contain some bugs. We are trying to fix them. We continue to improve the code for this paper. We will continue to upload and improve the corresponding code.

Modules:
Caffe Library fileï¼šCaffe library files and python interface and some essential scripts
data: train data and test data (Because our training dataset is relatively large, it is not convenient to upload here.)
experiments: logs and cfgs and scripts of experiments
lib: BRPN and detection-network and other modules 
models: CNN models(AlexNet, ZF,VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet)
run: Run the program and load the network code
ExtractInterface: Generate multi-level training dataset
